# Smart Grocery Tracker
A learning-driven full-stack project built step by step

## Why I Built This Project
I started this project to practice basic frontend development by creating a simple grocery list. As I used it more, I realised that a real shopping app needs more than just adding and removing items.
This project became my way to learn full-stack development gradually, by solving real problems instead of following tutorials.

## What the App Does (Current)
- Create a grocery list
- Add new items manually
- Separate items into:
- Pending items
- Purchased items
- Mark items as purchased
- Remove items from the list

## How This Project Evolved
Phase 1 – Frontend Foundation
- Built the UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Learned DOM manipulation and event handling
- Managed item state (pending vs purchased)
- Improved layout and usability through iteration

## Current Limitations
At the moment:
- Data is stored only in the browser
- Refreshing the page clears the list
- Items are available only on one device

## Planned Enhancements (Learning Roadmap)
Planned learning steps include:
Backend Integration
- Persist grocery items using a backend service
- Create APIs to:
    * Add items
    * Update item status
    * Fetch saved lists
Database Design
- Store grocery items with:
    * Name
    * Status (pending / purchased)
    * Timestamps
    * Learn real-world data modelling
Barcode Scanning
- Use the device camera to scan product barcodes
- Automatically mark scanned items as purchased
- Handle unknown or missing product data gracefully
Product Improvements
- Shopping history
- Re-adding frequently purchased items
- Improved mobile usability
- Accessibility improvements

## What I’m Learning From This Project
- Frontend fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- State management and UI logic
- Why and when backend systems are needed
- API-based communication between frontend and backend
- Data persistence and real-world app design
- Thinking like a product developer, not just a coder

## Why I Chose This Approach
Instead of building many small demo projects, I chose to:
- Build one meaningful app
- Improve it step by step
- Learn each layer only when it becomes necessary

## Future Vision
The long-term vision is to turn this into a personal shopping assistant that:
- Works across devices
- Reduces manual tracking
- Makes grocery shopping simpler and faster

## About the Developer
I am an aspiring full-stack developer focused on hands-on learning.
I enjoy building practical applications and improving them through iteration and feedback.

This project represents my learning journey and problem-solving approach.
