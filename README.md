# Smart Grocery Tracker
**Author:** Karthiha Krishnan
**Role:** Aspiring Full-Stack Developer

## Project Overview
Smart Grocery Tracker is a learning-focused web application that started as a simple grocery list and is being evolved into a full-stack project.
The goal of this project is not just to build features, but to understand how real-world applications grow — from frontend interactions to backend data persistence.
This project represents my hands-on approach to learning full-stack development through practical problem-solving.

## Current Version: Version 1.4 — Polished, Readable, Portfolio-Ready UI

## Why I Built This Project
I initially built this app to strengthen my frontend fundamentals using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
While using the app, I realised that a real grocery or shopping app needs:
- Persistent data
- Clear separation of item states
- A reliable source of truth
- Support for real-world workflows (such as barcode scanning)

Instead of stopping at a basic implementation, I decided to continue developing this single project as my full-stack learning journey.

## Current Features
- Create a grocery list
- Add new items manually
- Separate items into:
   * Pending items
   * Purchased items
- Mark items as purchased
- Remove items from the list
- Simple and clear user interface
- Persistent storage using browser localstorage (items remain after refresh).

The current version focuses on clean UI behaviour and state management.

## How This Project Evolved
Phase 1 – Frontend Foundation
- Built the interface using HTML and CSS
- Implemented interactive behaviour with JavaScript
- Learned DOM manipulation and event handling
- Managed UI state changes between pending and purchased items
- Iteratively improved layout and usability

This phase helped me understand how user actions drive application state.

Phase 2 - Data Persistence
- Introduced a data-driven render architecture 
- Implemented browser-based persistence using localstorage
- Ensured grocery items survive page refresh and browser restart.
- Designed the app with a single source of truth for easier backend migration

This shows growth, not just features.

## Current Limitations
At the moment:
- Data is stored only in the browser
- Refreshing the page clears the list
- Items are available only on one device

These limitations are intentional and have helped me clearly understand why backend systems are required in real applications.

## Planned Enhancements (Full-Stack Roadmap)
This project will continue to evolve with the following learning goals:
Backend Integration (planned)
- Persist grocery items using a backend service
- Create APIs to:
    * Add items
    * Update item status
    * Fetch saved lists
Database Design (planned)
- Store grocery items with:
    * Name
    * Status (pending / purchased)
    * Timestamps
- Learn real-world data modelling
Barcode Scanning (planned)
- Use the device camera to scan product barcodes
- Automatically mark scanned items as purchased
- Handle unknown or missing product data gracefully
Product Improvements (planned)
- Shopping history
- Re-adding frequently purchased items
- Improved mobile usability
- Accessibility improvements

## What I’m Learning From This Project
- Frontend fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- State management and UI logic
- Why and when backend systems are needed
- API-based communication between frontend and backend
- Data persistence and real-world app design
- Thinking like a product developer, not just a coder

## Why I Chose This Approach
Instead of building many small demo projects, I chose to:
- Build one meaningful app
- Improve it step by step
- Learn each layer only when it becomes necessary

This approach reflects how real software products are developed in professional environments.

## Future Vision
The long-term vision is to turn this into a personal shopping assistant that:
- Works across devices
- Reduces manual tracking
- Uses barcode scanning for faster shopping
- Demonstrates a complete full-stack workflow

## About Me
I am an aspiring full-stack developer focused on hands-on learning.
I enjoy building practical applications and improving them through iteration and feedback.
This project represents my learning journey and problem-solving approach.

## Technologies Used
Current:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Browser Localstorage
Planned:
- Backend development (to be introduced)
- Database integration
